# Tetris Game

This repository contains a minimal Flutter implementation of the classic Tetris game. The game logic is implemented in `lib/main.dart` and can be run on any Flutter-supported platform.

## Getting Started

1. Ensure [Flutter](https://flutter.dev/) is installed.
2. Fetch dependencies:
   ```bash
   flutter pub get
   ```
3. Run the app:
   ```bash
   flutter run
   ```

Use the arrow keys to move pieces and the spacebar to rotate them.
